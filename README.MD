Day 41: Union-Find
<br>
Union-Find is a data structure that is capable of tracking and merging of disjoint sets. As a structure it is very important inside other algorithms like Prolog unification or percolation problem.
<br>
There are two signification improvements that can be made to speed the algorithm up, weighting and path compression. Iâ€™ve implemented path compression, only, the code is short and performance is pretty good.

run:
```
fn main() {
    let n = 10usize;
    let mut data = Vec::<usize>::from_iter(0..n);
    let connections:Vec<(usize, usize)> = vec![(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 9), (5, 6), (6, 4), (5, 9)];
    for c in connections{
        union(&mut data, c.0, c.1);
    }
    for i in 0..n{
        println!("item {} -> component {}", i, find(&mut data, i));
    }
}
```
result:
```
item 0 -> component 9
item 1 -> component 9
item 2 -> component 9
item 3 -> component 3
item 4 -> component 9
item 5 -> component 9
item 6 -> component 9
item 7 -> component 7
item 8 -> component 8
item 9 -> component 9
```
